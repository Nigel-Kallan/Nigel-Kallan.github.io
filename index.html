I have been in Canada for over thirty years and worked in many fields in various positions. Hydraulic Mechanic, Plant Manager, Event Promoter and General Manager are a few titles I held during those years. I am currently studying Web Development for a multiple of reasons, including its high demand in the job market, the flexibility it offers, and the creative and problem-solving opportunities it presents.</p>
